# Lighting

You've created the basic elements to start working on your game, but what about the lighting and visuals? 

If you switch from the Scene view to the Game view, you'll see that the player GameObject is lit and it casts a shadow on the plane. 

This is because all new Unity scenes come with the default sky box and a directional light to represent the sun. 

Let's tweak this value to adjust the scene a little. 

In the Hierarchy, select the Directional Light and then review it in the Inspector. 

Change the tint of the light from a yellow to a pure white. 

Do this by selecting the colored selection square to bring up the color wheel. 

You can use the color picker to choose a color. 

To get specific results, it's best to select the exact values. 

For solid white, set the RGB values to 255, 255, and 255. 

This is looking much better. 

However the gray player sphere is difficult to see on the gray background. 

In the next video, you'll add some color to the game.
